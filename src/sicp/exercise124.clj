; Exercise 1.24: Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of
; Exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime? (the Fermat method), and
; test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise. Since
; the Fermat test has Î˜(log n) growth, how would you expect
; the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with the
; time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data bear
; this out? Can you explain any discrepancy you find?

; The order of growth when using the optimized prime? function should be log n,
; and the data proves that this is roughly true, since
; search-for-primes(1000) = aprox. 1.5
; and the result for search-for-primes(1000000) = aprox. 3.2
; If the growth is logarithmic then
; search-for-primes(1000000)/search-for-primes(1000) = log(1000000/1000)
; which it roughly is.
